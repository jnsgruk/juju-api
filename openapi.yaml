  title: "Juju Client API"
  summary: Next generation Juju client API draft.
  description: |
    This specification represents early but ongoing design work for a next-generation, RESTful Juju
    client API. It **should not** be used as reference for any currently released version of Juju,
    and is unlikely to be implemented until some time in 2024.

    The source code for this page, and the OpenAPI specification can be found on
    [Github](https://github.com/jnsgruk/juju-api). You can also find a progress tracker that
    indicates which of the prior facade calls have been covered by this design.

    The [OpenAPI Spec](https://github.com/jnsgruk/juju-api/blob/main/openapi.yaml) can be entered
    directly into the [Swagger Editor](https://editor-next.swagger.io/) for a slightly different
    experience when exploring the API if preferable.

    In addition to the new design, there is a [naive
    conversion](https://jnsgruk.github.io/juju-api/generated.html) of the existing Juju facade
    schema available. This was generated from the upstream
    [schema.json](https://github.com/juju/juju/blob/3.3/apiserver/facades/schema.json) and is used
    solely for the purposes of reference, and enables existing schemas to be easily reused during
    the design on the new API where appropriate.
